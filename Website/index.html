  <p> Musicalingo is a company based in the United Kingdom and we aim to teach kids from ages 2 and up to learn music. We have lessons on a Monday and Friday and hope to inspire young children to whant to sing or get involved with music.<p>
      <p>Musicalingo was formed thanks to another company which is called prodigies. However it is only located in the US and so we aim to bring it to the UK. Here is a video from prodgies explaining what musiclaingo is and how it works for your children:</p>
